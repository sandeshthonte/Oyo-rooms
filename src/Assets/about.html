            In 2012, Ritesh Agarwal launched Oravel Stays to enable listing and booking of budget accommodations; he renamed the firm to OYO in 2013.

            OYO partners with hotels to give similar guest experience across cities. Shortly after launching Oravel Stays, Ritesh Agarwal received a grant of $100,000 as part of the Thiel Fellowship from Peter Thiel. OYO currently has over 17,000 employees globally, of which approximately 8000 are in India and South Asia. OYO Hotels & Homes is a full-fledged hotel chain that leases and franchises assets. The company invests in capex, hires GMs to oversee operations and customer experience as well as generating around a million job opportunities in India and South Asia alone. OYO has also set up 26 training institutes for hospitality enthusiasts across India.
            
            In April 2021, it was claimed by several news reports and social media posts that OYO had filed for bankruptcy, but CEO Ritesh Agarwal clarified it to be untrue. However he admitted that the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) initiated a insolvency resolution process on OYO Hotels on the basis of a hotelier's petition over a monetary dispute with the company.

            In September 2018, OYO raised $1 billion, of which the RoC filing for the amount of $100 million raised from Star Virtue Investment Ltd. was made on 13 February 2019.

In February 2019, Oyo received $100 million funding from the Chinese vehicle for hire company Didi Chuxing.

In July 2019, Founder & CEO Ritesh Agarwal, through RA Hospitality Holdings (Cayman), signed a $2 billion deal to buy back shares from existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia India, to increase his stake in the company to 30%. The company was valued at $10 billion with this deal.

In October 2019, Oyo raised Series F funding of $1.5 billion led by SoftBank Group, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia India.

            In 2019, OYO rooms planned to implement a digital register mechanism which will allow it to share customer data in real time with the government. This was described as a threat to privacy.

OYO has been accused of using predatory pricing and not following its own agreements including threatening hotels to unilaterally change some of the clauses or not be paid.

In 2018, the company sent mass unsolicited job offer emails targeting senior- and mid-level employees of competitors.
